# Add pyenv executable to PATH and
# enable shims by adding the following
# to ~/.profile and ~/.zprofile:

#export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
#export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
#eval "$(pyenv init --path)"

# Load pyenv into the shell by adding
# the following to ~/.zshrc:

eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# Make sure to restart your entire logon session
